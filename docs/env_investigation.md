# CI/CD Environment Setup Investigation

### Objective
Verified installation of all required dependencies in local environment and analyzed test environment behavior to prepare for CI/CD integration.

### Findings
- Successfully installed all dependencies under Python 3.13 except `playsound` due to a wheel build issue.
- All libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Tkinter, CTkMenuBar installed successfully.
- Two test files (`test_screen.py`, `database_test.py`) failed due to module path imports (`shared`, `databases`), not code errors.
- Confirmed `main.py` runs successfully.

### Recommendations
- Add a `conftest.py` or set `PYTHONPATH=.` in CI to resolve imports.
- Mock or skip `playsound` dependency for CI pipelines.
- Next step: Contribute to existing GitHub Actions workflow for automated lint/test runs.

### Validation Commands

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
python main.py
